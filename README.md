# IOT-based-Ambulance-Evacuation-System

The massive increase in vehicle traffic necessitates a complete overhaul of the current emergency vehicle route clearing systems. Systems that employ image processing technology for effective traffic control exist in metropolitan areas. With the help of this method, the ambulance may be quickly transported from the congested area to the hospital. The device can make a prompt and precise choice by communicating with the approaching emergency ambulance and traffic signal. This device has the potential to save lives quickly and efficiently. While as students, we had the great opportunity to learn a great deal about IOT and Programming. Which also happen to be the 20th century's most significantÂ fields.
